## Important installations
You will need to install the following software tools: 

* R 
* R Studio

And then the following packages in R:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "umap"))
```

## R and Rstudio

**R** is a language for statistical computing and graphics. **RStudio** is an interactive desktop environment (IDE), but it is not R, nor does it include R when you download and install it. Therefore, to use RStudio, we first need to install R.

## Installing R (Windows and Mac)

You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)^[https://cran.r-project.org/]. Search for CRAN on your browser:

![](figs/VirtualBox_Windows-7-Enterprise_22_03_2018_16_12_59.png)

## Installing R (Windows and Mac) 

Once on the CRAN page, select the version for your operating system: Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows. Here we show screenshots for Windows, but the process is similar for the other platforms. When they differ, we will also show screenshots for Mac OS X.

![](figs/VirtualBox_Windows-7-Enterprise_22_03_2018_16_13_21.png)

## Installing RStudio (Windows and Mac)

To install RStudio, start by searching for "RStudio" on your browser:

![](figs/rstudio_install_1.png)

## Installing RStudio (Mac)
You should find the Posit/RStudio website as shown above. Once there, click on "Download RStudio Desktop for Mac OS 12+" below the _2: Install RStudio_ header.

## More on R and Rstudio

See more detailed instructions at in Lecture 1 at: [https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2024_04_R_tutorial](https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2024_04_R_tutorial)

## Why R?

R is not a programming language for software development like C or Java. It was created by statisticians as an environment for data analysis. A history of R is summarized here: [A Brief History of S](http://lcolladotor.github.io/courses/Courses/R/resources/history_of_S.pdf). 

![](figs/r_rstudio.png){height=40%}

The __interactivity__ of R (more later), is an indispensable feature in data science because, as you will learn, the ability to quickly explore data is a necessity for success in this field. 

## RStudio

One of the great advantages of R over point-and-click analysis software is that you can save your work as scripts. You can edit and save these scripts using a text editor. We will use the interactive _Integrated Development Environment_ (IDE) [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). 

![](figs/rstudio.png)

## Installing R packages

The functionality provided by a fresh install of R is only a small fraction of what is possible. In fact, we refer to what you get after your first install as __base R__. The extra functionality comes from add-ons available from developers. 

There are currently hundreds of these available from CRAN and many others shared via other repositories such as GitHub. However, because not everybody needs all available functionality, R instead makes different components available via __packages__. 

## Installing R packages
R makes it very easy to install packages from within R. For example, to install the __ggplot2__ package, which we use to plot our data, you would type:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

We can install more than one package at once by feeding a character vector to this function:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "umap"))
```

## Motivating Example
The `TBnanostring.rds` dataset contains gene expression measurements in the blood for 107 TB-related genes for 179 patients with either active tuberculosis infection (TB) or latent TB infection (LTBI) from one of [Dr. Johnson's publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35015839/).

![](figs/tbnanostring.png)

## Data Frames 
A large proportion of data analysis challenges start with data stored in a data frame. For example, we stored the data for our motivating example in a data frame. You can access this dataset by loading __TBNanostring.rds__ object in R:

```{r}
TBnanostring <- readRDS("TBnanostring.rds")
```

## Data Frames 
In RStudio we can view the data with the `View` function:

```{r, eval=F}
View(TBnanostring)
```

You will notice that the TB status is found in the first column of the data frame, followed by the genes in the subsequent columns. The rows represent each individual patient. 

## Data Visualization with R
Exploratory data visualization is perhaps the greatest strength of R. One can quickly go from idea to data to plot with a unique balance of flexibility and ease. 

## Motivating Example: PCA
Here is a PCA clustering of the TB Nanostring dataset. The points are colored based on TB status.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="70%", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6}
TBnanostring <- readRDS("TBnanostring.rds")

pca_out <- prcomp(TBnanostring[,-1])
  
pca_reduction <- as.data.frame(pca_out$x)
pca_reduction$Condition <- as.factor(TBnanostring$TB_Status)

pca_reduction %>% ggplot(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Condition)) + 
    geom_point() + xlab("PC 1") + ylab("PC 2") + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + ggtitle("PCA Plot")
```

## Motivating Example: UMAP
Here is a UMAP clustering of the some dataset.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="70%", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6}
TBnanostring <- readRDS("TBnanostring.rds")

set.seed(0)
library(umap)
umap_out <- umap(TBnanostring[,-1])
umap_reduction <- as.data.frame(umap_out$layout)
umap_reduction$Condition <- as.factor(TBnanostring$TB_Status)

umap_reduction %>% ggplot(aes(x=V1, y=V2, color=Condition)) + 
    geom_point() + xlab("UMAP 1") + ylab("UMAP 2") + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + ggtitle("UMAP Plot")
```

##  Dimension reduction 

A typical machine learning challenge will include a large number of predictors, which makes visualization somewhat challenging. We have shown methods for visualizing univariate and paired data, but plots that reveal relationships between many variables are more complicated in higher dimensions. 

##  Dimension reduction 

Here we describe powerful techniques useful for exploratory data analysis, among other things, generally referred to as __dimension reduction__. 

The general idea is to reduce the dimension of the dataset while preserving important characteristics, such as the distance between features or observations.

The technique behind it all, the singular value decomposition, is also useful in other contexts. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the approach we will be showing first. Before applying PCA to high-dimensional datasets, we will motivate the ideas behind with a simple example.


## Dimension reduction: twin heights 

We consider a simulated example with twin heights (children and adults):

```{r, message=FALSE}
set.seed(1988)
library(MASS)
n <- 100
Sigma <- matrix(c(9, 9 * 0.9, 9 * 0.92, 9 * 1), 2, 2)
x <- rbind(mvrnorm(n / 2, c(69, 69), Sigma),
           mvrnorm(n / 2, c(55, 55), Sigma))
```

## Dimension reduction: twin heights 
A scatterplot reveals that the correlation is high and there are two groups of twins: adults and children:

```{r distance-illustration, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
plot(x, xlab='Twin 2',ylab='Twin 1')
points(x[c(1, 2, 51),], pch = 16)
```

## Dimension reduction: twin heights 
Now, can we pick a one-dimensional summary that makes this approximation even better?

If we look back at the previous scatterplot and visualize a line between any pair of points, the length of this line is the distance between the two points. These lines tend to go along the direction of the diagonal. Notice that if we instead plot the difference versus the average:

```{r}
z  <- cbind(average=(x[,2] + x[,1])/2,  
            difference=x[,2] - x[,1])
```

## Dimension reduction: twin heights 
We can see how the distance between points is mostly explained by the first dimension: the average.

```{r rotation, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
plot(z)
points(z[c(1,2,51),], pch = 16)
```


## Principal component analysis (PCA)

Dimension reduction can often be described as applying a transformation that _moves_ or _rotates_ the information, then keeping just these few informative columns, thus reducing the dimension of the vectors contained in the rows.

![](figs/princomps.png)


## Principal component analysis {#pca}

The __first principal component (PC)__ of a matrix $X$ is the linear orthogonal transformation of $X$ that maximizes the variability. The function `prcomp` provides this info:

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(x)
pca
```

Note that the first PC is (almost) the same as the mean we used earlier and the second is (almost) the difference!

## Non-linear transformations: UMAP
Check out the following links:

* [https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/)
* [https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/supplement.html](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/)

## Non-linear transformations: UMAP
The intuitions behind the core principles are actually quite simple: UMAP essentially constructs a weighted graph from the high dimensional data, with edge strength representing how “close” a given point is to another, then projects this graph down to a lower dimensionality. The advanced mathematics (topology) gives UMAP a solid footing with which to handle the challenges of doing this in high dimensions with real data.

## PCA on the Nanostring data
```{r}
pca_out <- prcomp(TBnanostring[,-1])
  
## make a dataframe with the results 
pca_reduction <- as.data.frame(pca_out$x)
pca_reduction$Condition <- as.factor(TBnanostring$TB_Status)

# View(pca_reduction)
```

## UMAP on the Nanostring data
```{r}
set.seed(0)
library(umap)
umap_out <- umap(TBnanostring[,-1])

## make a dataframe with the results 
umap_reduction <- as.data.frame(umap_out$layout)
umap_reduction$Class <- as.factor(TBnanostring$TB_Status)

# View(umap_reduction)
```

## Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
We will be creating plots using the `ggplot2`^[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/] package. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2) ## loaded with the tidyverse
```

Many other approaches are available for creating plots in R. In fact, the plotting capabilities that come with a basic installation of R are already quite powerful. There are also other packages for creating graphics such as __grid__ and __lattice__. 

We chose to use `ggplot2` because it breaks plots into components in a way that permits beginners to create relatively complex and aesthetically pleasing plots using syntax that is intuitive and comparatively easy to remember. 

## Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
One reason `ggplot2` is generally more intuitive for beginners is that it uses a __grammar of graphics__^[http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447], the _gg_ in `ggplot2`. 

This is analogous to the way learning grammar can help a beginner construct hundreds of different sentences by learning just a handful of verbs, nouns and adjectives without having to memorize each specific sentence. Similarly, by learning a handful of `ggplot2` building blocks and its grammar, you will be able to create hundreds of different plots. 

## Data Visualization with `ggplot2`

One limitation is that `ggplot2` is designed to work exclusively with data tables in tidy format (where rows are observations and columns are variables). However, most datasets that beginners work with acan be converted into this format. 

## Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
To use `ggplot2`  you will have to learn several functions and arguments. These are hard to memorize, so we highly recommend you have the ggplot2 cheat sheet  handy. 

You can get a copy with an internet search for "ggplot2 cheat sheet" or by clinking here: 

[https://statsandr.com/blog/files/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf](https://statsandr.com/blog/files/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)

## The Components of a Graph
The first step in learning `ggplot2` is to be able to break a graph apart into components. The main three components to note are:
 
* __Data__: The US murders data table is being summarized. 
*  __Geometry__: The plot above is a scatterplot. Other possible geometries are barplot, histogram, smooth densities, qqplot, and boxplot. 
* __Aesthetic mapping__: The plot uses several visual cues to represent the information provided by the dataset. The two most important cues in this plot are the point positions on the x-axis and y-axis. Each point represents a different observation, and we _map_ data about these observations to visual cues. Color is another visual cue that we map to region. 

## Layers of a plot

In `ggplot2` we create graphs by adding __layers__. Layers can define geometries, compute summary statistics, define what scales to use, or even change styles.

To add layers, we use the symbol `+`. In general, like this:

>> data %>% `ggplot()` + layer 1 (geom) + ... + layer N

## `ggplot` objects 

The first step in creating a `ggplot2` graph is to define a `ggplot` object. We do this with the function `ggplot`, which initializes the graph.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = pca_reduction)
```

We can also pipe the data in as the first argument, and save it in an object. So this line of code is equivalent to the previous one:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p <- pca_reduction %>% ggplot()
```

## `ggplot` objects 
It renders a plot, in this case a blank slate since no geometry has been defined. The only style choice we see is a grey background.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6}
p <- pca_reduction %>% ggplot()
p
```

## Geometries
Usually, the first added layer defines the geometry. We want to make a scatterplot. What geometry do we use? Taking a quick look at the cheat sheet, we see that the function used to create plots with this geometry is `geom_point`. 

![](figs/ggplot2-cheatsheeta.png)

## Geometries

Geometry function names follow the pattern: `geom_X` where X is the name of the geometry. Some examples include `geom_point`, `geom_bar`, and `geom_histogram`.

For `geom_point` to run properly we need to provide data and a mapping (aesthetic). In this case, two aesthetic arguments are required: `x` and `y`. 
 
## Geometries: `geom_point`
For example, to make a scatter plot for the PCA components:
```{r, out.width="60%", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6}
p + geom_point(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2))
```

## Geometries: additional options
We can change the shape or color of the points
```{r,out.width="60%", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6}
p + geom_point(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2), shape=1)
```

## Adding Layers
Now we can add layers that change the labels, title, etc:

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6}
p + geom_point(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Condition), shape=1) + 
  xlab("PC 1") + ylab("PC 2") + ggtitle("PCA Plot") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

## Final results: UMAP
Here is the final code for the UMAP plot:
\footnotesize
```{r, eval=F}
## read in data
TBnanostring <- readRDS("TBnanostring.rds")

## Apply UMAP reduction
set.seed(0)
library(umap)
umap_out <- umap(TBnanostring[,-1])

## Make dataframe for plotting in tidy format
umap_reduction <- as.data.frame(umap_out$layout)
umap_reduction$Condition <- as.factor(TBnanostring$TB_Status)

## Plot results with ggpplot
umap_reduction %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x=V1, y=V2, color=Condition), shape=1) + 
  xlab("UMAP 1") + ylab("UMAP 2") + ggtitle("UMAP Plot") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  
```

## Final results: UMAP
```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=6}
## read in data
TBnanostring <- readRDS("TBnanostring.rds")

## Apply UMAP reduction
set.seed(0)
library(umap)
umap_out <- umap(TBnanostring[,-1])

## Make dataframe for plotting in tidy format
umap_reduction <- as.data.frame(umap_out$layout)
umap_reduction$Condition <- as.factor(TBnanostring$TB_Status)

## Plot results with ggpplot
umap_reduction %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x=V1, y=V2, color=Condition), shape=1) + 
  xlab("UMAP 1") + ylab("UMAP 2") + ggtitle("UMAP Plot") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  
```

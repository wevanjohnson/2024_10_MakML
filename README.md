# MakML: Machine Learning Workshop (October 2024)

These are the materials for our Programming, Plotting, and Machine Learning Workshop at Makerere University in October 2024 (MakML). Hopefully they are helpful!

## Things you should know about this course

* Lots of diverse material and new concepts will be covered in this course
    + Programming and Machine Learning is __NOT__ a spectator sport! You need to practice the skills you learn over and over again!
* Communication: if you have questions or concerns, please email me: <w.evan.johnson@rutgers.edu>
* Materials for the course:
    + All materials for this course will be posted on the course GitHub page: [https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2024_10_MakML](https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2024_10_MakML)
    + You obviously have this since you are here!
* Dependencies (R packages to install and datasets to download):
    + Install R and R Studio
    + Please install the following R packages for Data Management: `tidyverse`, `DT`, and `gridExtra`. In R: `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "DT", "gridExtra"))`
    + Please install the following R packages for Machine learning: `caret`, `e1071`, `rpart`, `randomForest`, `neuralnet`. In R: `install.packages(c("caret", "e1071", "rpart", "randomForest", "neuralnet"))`
    + You will need the following datasets: ESL.mixture.rda, TBnanostring.rds
